## Notes on KCS Versions

The 'defintive' shareware version was available as a download from Tim's Atari Midi World which is no longer online.

Fortunately a mirror exists of that site, here - https://www.exxoshost.co.uk/atari/mirror/tamw/

The KCS pages are https://www.exxoshost.co.uk/atari/mirror/tamw/omega.htm where a file kcs4.zip can be downloaded. The following notice is on that page, relating to this zip;
